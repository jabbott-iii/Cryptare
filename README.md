# Cryptare

Cryptare is a terminal tool for encrypting, decrypting, compressing and extracting files and directories. It combines a scriptable command-line interface with an interactive terminal UI and a small local store for password-protected keys. It is meant for people who want password-based file protection and archiving from the command line.

## Features

- **File Encryption & Decryption**
  - Encrypt files of any size with AES-256-GCM, streamed in authenticated chunks, under a key derived from your password with Argon2id
  - Encrypt directories into a single encrypted archive
  - Decrypt previously encrypted files
  - Decrypt encrypted directory archives back into their original tree
  - Optional custom output paths
  - Password-based protection for secure workflows

- **Compression & Decompression**
  - Compress files with gzip
  - Compress files or directories as zip archives
  - Compress directories as tar.gz archives
  - Decompress gzip files, tar.gz archives, and zip archives
  - Optional compression levels
  - Automatic output name derivation

- **Key Management**
  - Generate and store encryption keys
  - List stored keys
  - Export keys to encrypted files
  - Import keys from encrypted files
  - Delete stored keys with confirmation safeguards

- **Interactive TUI**
  - Terminal user interface for file and key management
  - Launches automatically when run without subcommands

## Use cases

- Protect a sensitive document before copying it to a USB drive or cloud storage: `cryptare encrypt ./tax-return.pdf`
- Back up a project folder as one encrypted file, then restore it later: `cryptare encrypt ./project-dir --output ./project-dir-backup.enc`, then `cryptare decrypt ./project-dir-backup.enc --output ./restored-project-dir`
- Package build output as a tar.gz or zip archive for sharing, and extract archives you receive: `cryptare compress ./build --format zip`, `cryptare decompress ./build-backup.tar.gz`
- Use menus instead of flags: run `cryptare` (or `cryptare --vim` for vim-style keys)

## Prerequisites

- To build from source: Go 1.26 or newer (`go.mod` selects Go 1.26.8, which an older `go` command downloads automatically unless `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` is set), plus a C compiler (gcc or clang) with CGO enabled. The SQLite driver used for the key store requires CGO. On Windows this means a CGO-capable toolchain such as MinGW-w64.
- Optional: Docker, to build and run the container image.

## Installation

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jabbott-iii/Cryptare.git
cd Cryptare
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o cryptare .
sudo mv cryptare /usr/local/bin/cryptare   # optional: put it on your PATH
```

### Release archives

Tagged releases publish these assets, built by `.github/workflows/cd.yml`, together with a `checksums.txt` file (SHA-256):

| Platform | Asset |
|---|---|
| Linux x86-64 | `cryptare_linux_amd64.tar.gz` |
| Linux ARM64 | `cryptare_linux_arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS Intel | `cryptare_darwin_amd64.tar.gz` |
| macOS Apple silicon | `cryptare_darwin_arm64.tar.gz` |
| Windows x86-64 | `cryptare_windows_amd64.zip` |

Each archive holds the binary named after it (`cryptare_linux_amd64`, `cryptare_windows_amd64.exe`, …). Archives of releases after v1.2.0 also hold `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`, which has the licences of the Go standard library, the Go modules and the C libraries built into the binary. The Linux binaries are statically linked, so they run on any distribution; releases after v1.3.0 link them against musl instead of glibc. There is no Windows ARM64 build.

> ⚠️ The v1.0.0 binaries were built with CGO disabled and exit on every command with `go-sqlite3 requires cgo to work`. Use v1.0.1 or later (BUG-001 in [intel/notes.md](intel/notes.md)).

To install a release on Linux, download its archive and `checksums.txt` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jabbott-iii/Cryptare/releases) (replace `v1.1.0` with the release you want), check the hash, and put the binary on your PATH:

```bash
VERSION=v1.1.0
curl -LO "https://github.com/jabbott-iii/Cryptare/releases/download/${VERSION}/cryptare_linux_amd64.tar.gz"
curl -LO "https://github.com/jabbott-iii/Cryptare/releases/download/${VERSION}/checksums.txt"
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt
tar -xzf cryptare_linux_amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x cryptare_linux_amd64
sudo mv cryptare_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/cryptare
```

- macOS: use the matching `darwin` archive in the same way, and check its hash with `shasum -a 256`.
- Windows: extract the zip, rename `cryptare_windows_amd64.exe` to `cryptare.exe`, and add it to your PATH.

## Quick start

```bash
cryptare encrypt ./secret.txt        # prompts for a password; prints "Encrypted: ./secret.txt → ./secret.txt.enc"
cryptare decrypt ./secret.txt.enc    # prompts for the password; prints "Decrypted: ./secret.txt.enc → ./secret.txt"
cryptare                             # opens the interactive TUI
```

- Commands don't overwrite anything by default:
  - if the output file or folder already exists, the command stops; add `--force` to overwrite it;
  - an output that is the input itself is always refused, even with `--force`, as is compressing or encrypting a folder into a file inside that folder;
  - `keys export` follows the same rule (`--force` to overwrite), and never writes over the key store itself;
  - the TUI never overwrites, so choose a different output path there;
  - a command that fails part-way, or that you stop, leaves no partial output, and a file or folder it was replacing with `--force` is kept;
  - with `--force`, an existing output folder is replaced as a whole, not merged into: files in it that aren't in the archive are removed. Extracting into the folder that holds the archive itself is refused;
  - on Linux and macOS, everything the tool writes is private to you: output files are mode 0600, and extracted or decrypted folders are 0700 with files inside at 0600 (0700 for files the archive marks executable). Permissions stored in an archive are otherwise ignored. **On Windows** these modes don't apply: what Cryptare writes, the key store included, gets the permissions of the folder it is written to. Your own profile folders are normally private, but a shared location such as `C:\Users\Public` or a shared drive is readable by everyone who can read that folder, so write decrypted output and the key store to a folder only you can read.
- Stopping a command: Ctrl+C (or `kill`, or closing the terminal) during `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `compress` or `decompress` stops it and removes its unfinished output. It exits with status 128 plus the signal number (130 for Ctrl+C), and a second Ctrl+C ends it at once. At the hidden password prompt, any of these signals ends the command with your terminal's echo restored. Quitting the TUI while an action runs cancels the action first ("Cancelling…"). Only a forced kill (`kill -9`) or a power loss can still leave a hidden `.<name>.*.tmp` file or folder behind.
- Extraction is limited to protect against decompression bombs: `decompress`, and `decrypt` for an encrypted folder, stop after 10 GiB of output or 100,000 archive entries, and remove what they wrote. Change the limits with `--max-size` and `--max-entries` (`0` means no limit). The TUI always uses the defaults.
- The password prompt reads the whole line, spaces included, and hides what you type when run in a terminal. When input is piped in, the first line is used.
- New passwords must be at least 15 characters long, and a single repeated character (such as `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`) is refused. Any characters count, including spaces, and no mix of character types is required, so a few unrelated words make a good password. This applies to `encrypt`, `keys generate` and `keys export`, whether the password comes from the prompt, `--password` or the TUI.
- When you type a new password in a terminal or the TUI, you're asked to type it again to confirm it. Piped input is read once.
- A password is the same however its characters were entered: an accented letter typed as one character or as a letter followed by a combining accent, full-width letters, ligatures and similar variants are made equal (Unicode NFKC normalisation), and a byte order mark that an editor put at the start of a `--password-file` is ignored. The 15-character minimum counts the password after this.
- Decrypting and importing accept any password, so files and keys protected with a shorter password before this rule existed still open.
- In scripts, keep passwords off the command line: use `--password-file` (the first line of a file, ideally one only you can read) or pipe the password in (`cryptare encrypt ./secret.txt < pw.txt`). `--password` still works but prints a warning, because other users can see command-line arguments and your shell saves them in its history.
- ⚠️ **Upgrading from v1.0.1 or earlier:** the old prompt kept only the text before the first space. If you encrypted a file at the prompt with a multi-word passphrase, decrypt it with just the first word. See SEC-002 in [intel/cybersec.md](intel/cybersec.md).
- ⚠️ **Upgrading from v1.1.0 or earlier:**
  - new encrypted files, folders, stored keys and key exports use the versioned format (see "File format" below), which v1.1.0 and earlier can't read. Upgrade every machine that needs to decrypt them; this version still reads everything older versions wrote;
  - scripts that pass `encrypt`, `keys generate` or `keys export` a password shorter than 15 characters now fail. To export a key whose master password is shorter, choose an export password of 15 or more characters;
  - `decompress --force` and `decrypt --force` now replace an existing output folder instead of adding to it;
  - archives over 10 GiB of output or 100,000 entries need `--max-size` or `--max-entries`;
  - `--password` now prints a warning on stderr; switch scripts to `--password-file` or piped input;
  - on Linux and macOS, the `keys` commands and the TUI refuse a key store that another user owns or that others can write to (see `CRYPTARE_DB_PATH` under [Configuration](#configuration));
  - extracted files and folders no longer keep the archive's permissions; they are owner-only (see above);
  - `keys export` refuses an existing output file unless you add `--force`, and always refuses the key store;
  - `encrypt dir/` and `encrypt .` now write the encrypted file next to the folder (`dir.enc`, `<parent>/<name>.enc`) instead of inside it, and an `--output` inside the folder being encrypted is refused;
  - `compress --format` that contradicts the `--output` extension, and `--level` values other than 1–9 or -1, are refused instead of being silently replaced (the TUI checks the same);
  - `--password ""` now means an empty password instead of prompting;
  - files without Cryptare's format header (from v1.1.0 and earlier) are read whole, so `decrypt` refuses one larger than `--max-size` (default 10 GiB) before reading it; raise `--max-size` for a bigger one. `keys import` refuses files over 1 MiB;
  - a `CRYPTARE_DB_PATH` containing `?` is refused (SQLite opened a different file); use a `file:` URI with `%3F`;
  - the Docker image runs as an unprivileged user (UID 10001); for a bind-mounted data folder, add `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"` (see [Docker](#docker)).
- ⚠️ **Upgrading from v1.2.0 or earlier** (changes on `main` since v1.2.0):
  - the key store is no longer `cryptare.db` in the current folder but `cryptare/cryptare.db` in your user data folder (see `CRYPTARE_DB_PATH` under [Configuration](#configuration)); `cryptare keys path` prints where it is. When a `keys` command or the TUI finds a `cryptare.db` in the current folder, it says so on stderr and shows how to move it there, or to keep using it with `CRYPTARE_DB_PATH`. It never opens or moves that file itself;
  - new data protected with a password that normalisation changes (accents typed as combining characters, full-width letters, a `--password-file` starting with a byte order mark, …) records this in its header, and v1.2.0 and earlier refuse it with "unsupported encrypted data: key derivation 2". Data protected with any other password is written as before, and v1.2.0 reads it;
  - data that v1.2.0 or earlier protected with a password typed with combining accents still needs the password typed that way.
- ⚠️ **Upgrading from v1.3.0** (changes on `main` since v1.3.0): v1.3.0 normalised a rare kind of password incorrectly: one with a vowel sign or length mark from scripts such as Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali, Oriya, Kannada, Sinhala or Myanmar, followed later by a combining accent such as an acute. A file that v1.3.0 protected with such a password doesn't open in later versions. Decrypt it with v1.3.0 and encrypt it again. Every other password works as before.

## Core CLI capabilities

Cryptare is organized into focused command groups:

- cryptare encrypt — encrypt a file or directory
- cryptare decrypt — decrypt a file or encrypted directory archive
- cryptare compress — compress a file or directory
- cryptare decompress — decompress a gzip file or extract a tar.gz/zip archive
- cryptare keys — manage encryption keys
- cryptare --version (or -v) — print the version: release builds report their tag, local builds report `dev`

### encrypt

- cryptare encrypt [path] — encrypt a file with AES-256-GCM or package a directory into a single encrypted archive
- cryptare encrypt [path] --output [path] — write to a custom output file
- cryptare encrypt [path] --force — overwrite the output if it already exists
- cryptare encrypt [path] --password-file [file] — read the encryption password from the first line of a file
- cryptare encrypt [path] --password [value] — provide the password on the command line (prints a warning; prefer --password-file)

Examples:
- cryptare encrypt ./secret.txt
- cryptare encrypt ./secret.txt --output ./secret.txt.enc
- cryptare encrypt ./project-dir --output ./project-dir-backup.enc
- cryptare encrypt ./secret.txt --password-file ~/.config/cryptare/pw.txt

File format: encrypted files and folders, stored keys and key exports are written in Cryptare's versioned format. Each password use runs Argon2id with 64 MiB of memory, 3 passes and 4 lanes, so it takes a moment. Files are encrypted and decrypted as a stream, so memory use doesn't grow with file size. This version still reads files, keys and exports made by earlier versions, and there's nothing to convert. Earlier versions, v1.1.0 included, can't read the new format: they report it as a wrong password or corrupted file. The layout is described in [intel/maint.md](intel/maint.md) §3.

### decrypt

- cryptare decrypt [path] — decrypt an AES-256-GCM encrypted file or restore an encrypted directory archive
- cryptare decrypt [path] --output [path] — write to a custom output file or restore into a target directory
- cryptare decrypt [path] --force — overwrite the output if it already exists
- cryptare decrypt [path] --password-file [file] — read the decryption password from the first line of a file
- cryptare decrypt [path] --password [value] — provide the password on the command line (prints a warning; prefer --password-file)
- cryptare decrypt [path] --max-size [size] --max-entries [n] — change the extraction limits for an encrypted folder (defaults 10 GiB and 100,000; 0 means no limit). `--max-size` also caps a file without Cryptare's format header (from v1.1.0 or earlier), which is read whole

Examples:
- cryptare decrypt ./secret.txt.enc
- cryptare decrypt ./secret.txt.enc --output ./secret.txt
- cryptare decrypt ./project-dir-backup.enc --output ./restored-project-dir
- cryptare decrypt ./secret.txt.enc --password-file ~/.config/cryptare/pw.txt

### compress

- cryptare compress [path] — compress with gzip (default) or zip
- cryptare compress [path] --output [path] — write to a custom output file or archive
- cryptare compress [path] --force — overwrite the output if it already exists
- cryptare compress [path] --format [gzip|zip] — select compression format
- cryptare compress [path] --level [1-9] — set the compression level (applies to gzip and zip; -1, the default, picks the standard level, and other values are refused)
- zip is also selected automatically when --output ends in .zip; a --format that contradicts the --output extension (gzip into `.zip`, zip into `.gz`, `.tgz` or `.tar.gz`) is refused
- compressing a single `.tar` file gives `x.tar.gz`, which `decompress` extracts as a tarball; use `decompress --raw` to get `x.tar` back

Examples:
- cryptare compress ./artifact.bin
- cryptare compress ./artifact.bin --output ./artifact.bin.gz
- cryptare compress ./build --output ./build-backup.tar.gz
- cryptare compress ./build --format zip --output ./build-backup.zip
- cryptare compress ./artifact.bin --level 9

### decompress

- cryptare decompress [archive] — decompress a gzip file or extract a tar.gz/zip archive
- cryptare decompress [archive] --output [path] — write to a custom output file or extract to a directory
- cryptare decompress [archive] --force — overwrite the output if it already exists (an existing folder is replaced, not merged into)
- cryptare decompress [archive] --max-size [size] — stop once the output passes this size (default 10 GiB; units B, KB, MB, GB, TB, KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB; 0 means no limit)
- cryptare decompress [archive] --max-entries [n] — stop if the archive has more entries than this (default 100,000; 0 means no limit)
- cryptare decompress [archive] --raw — gunzip only: write the decompressed data as one file without extracting a tar archive (`x.tar.gz` gives `x.tar`, `x.tgz` gives `x.tar`); not for zip archives. The TUI always extracts.

Examples:
- cryptare decompress ./artifact.bin.gz
- cryptare decompress ./artifact.bin.gz --output ./artifact.bin
- cryptare decompress ./build-backup.tar.gz --output ./restored-build
- cryptare decompress ./build-backup.zip --output ./restored-build
- cryptare decompress ./huge-dataset.tar.gz --max-size 50GiB
- cryptare decompress ./backup.tar.gz --raw

### keys

- cryptare keys list — list stored encryption keys
- cryptare keys path — print the key store's path (nothing is opened or created)
- cryptare keys generate — generate and store a new random encryption key
- cryptare keys export [key-id] — export an encrypted key to a file
- cryptare keys import [file] — import an encrypted key from a file (only exports in the format `keys export` writes are accepted)
- cryptare keys delete [key-id] — delete a stored encryption key (irreversible)
- cryptare keys delete [key-id] --yes — delete non-interactively (automation)
- cryptare keys delete [key-id] --force — delete non-interactively (automation)
- `generate`, `export` and `import` also take `--password-file [file]` (or `--password [value]`, which prints a warning)
- `export` takes `--force` to overwrite an existing output file; it never writes over the key store

Examples:
- cryptare keys list
- cryptare keys path
- cryptare keys generate --password-file ~/.config/cryptare/master.txt
- cryptare keys export key-123 --output key-123.ckey
- cryptare keys import ./key-123.ckey
- cryptare keys delete key-123
- cryptare keys delete key-123 --yes

⚠️ Key deletion is permanent. Deleting a key removes it and overwrites its encrypted data in the database file, so it can't be recovered from that file. Copies made earlier (backups, synced folders, git history) are not affected, and keys deleted with v1.1.0 or earlier may still be recoverable from the file until SQLite reuses that space.

### Interactive TUI

- Running cryptare with no subcommand launches the terminal UI dashboard for interactive file and key management.
- Run `cryptare --vim` to enable vim-style TUI bindings.
- With vim bindings enabled:
  - Menus accept `j`/`k` to move, `l` to select, and `Esc`, `h`, or `b` to go back when a back action exists.
  - Forms start in insert mode so file paths and passwords can be typed normally.
  - Press `Esc` in a form to switch to normal mode, then use `j`/`k` to change fields, `h` to cancel, `l` or `Enter` to advance, and `i`/`a`/`o` to return to insert mode. `o` moves to the next field before re-entering insert mode.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CRYPTARE_DB_PATH` (environment variable) | `cryptare/cryptare.db` in your user data folder: `$XDG_DATA_HOME` (if absolute) or `~/.local/share` on Linux and other Unix systems, `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS, `%LocalAppData%` on Windows | Location of the SQLite key store, as a path or a SQLite `file:` URI. `cryptare keys path` prints the one in use. The default's `cryptare` folder is created, readable only by you, the first time a `keys` command or the TUI needs it; versions up to v1.2.0 used `cryptare.db` in the current folder instead (see the upgrade note above). A plain path can't contain `?` (SQLite would cut it there); use a `file:` URI with `%3F` instead. Only the `keys` commands and the TUI open it, creating it if missing with mode 0600 (readable only by you on Linux and macOS; on Windows it gets the folder's permissions). An existing key store that others can read is set to 0600 when it is opened. On Linux and macOS, a key store, or its `-journal`, `-wal` or `-shm` file, that another user owns or that others can write to is refused; run `chmod 600` on a file of your own, or point `CRYPTARE_DB_PATH` at another key store. |
| `--vim` (flag) | off | Turns on vim-style key bindings in the TUI. |

Command flags (`--output`, `--password-file`, `--password`, `--format`, `--level`, `--yes`/`--force`) are described under [Core CLI capabilities](#core-cli-capabilities).

## Docker

The image builds Cryptare with CGO enabled for `linux/amd64`, from base images pinned by digest. It runs as an unprivileged user (UID and GID 10001), sets `CRYPTARE_DB_PATH=/app/data/cryptare.db` and declares `/app/data` as a volume owned by that user, so a named volume works as is. A bind-mounted host folder is owned by your host user instead, so run the container as that user with `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"`; the key store's ownership check (SEC-016) then passes too. Build with `--build-arg VERSION=<tag>` to set what `--version` reports (default `dev`).
